# Khat-Man

Overview:

This is a simple "game" I made with my little brother using the Godot game engine with GDScript. Has a lot of bugs and needs a lot of refinements to be playable. Posted this for my peeps on Twitter. I'm not a good programmer and my code is a mess, you've been warned!

Requirements:

To play/design the game you need Godot installed (https://godotengine.org/)

Feel free to change, design or contribute on this.
